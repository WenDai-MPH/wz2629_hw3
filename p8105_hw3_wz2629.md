# Problem 1:

Initial Step: setting up the environment for data analysis and
visualization, specifically involving packages like tidyverse, ggridges,
patchwork, and p8105.datasets. This Step also sets various options and
configurations for plotting and graphics.

### Step 1: read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.
